== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*In case of more questions or issues, please [visit the support forum](http://support.webmandesign.eu/ "WebMan Support Forum")*

= How to enable plugin features? =

You have to define the plugin support in your theme. Please see the `webman-amplifier/webman-amplifier-setup.php` file for instructions.

= How to upload custom icon font? =

The plugin supports icon font files from Fontello.com. Visit the website, select your icons and download the font. Please note that you should **not use the custom font file name** as the plutin only supports the default "fontello" font name (no need to type it in on Fontello.com website as this is predefined). After the font is downloaded, navigate to *"Appearance > Icon Font"* and upload your Fontello ZIP package file. Save the settings and new icons will be loaded.

= How to translate (localize) the plugin? =

First, plese note that custom translation files inside the plugin's `languages` folder will be removed / overwritten on plugin updates. If you're creating a custom translation files, please use the global WordPress language folder (usually `wp-content/languages/`). First create a `webman-amplifier` subfolder in the global WordPress language folder (you will end up with `wp-content/languages/webman-amplifier/` structure). Than FTP your translated plugin's file into this folder. Name the file as `wm_domain-LOCALE.mo` (for example: `wm_domain-en_US.mo`, so you'll end up with `wp-content/languages/webman-amplifier/wm_domain-en_US.mo`). Once you place the properly named localization file into the folder, the plugin should pick up your translation without any issues. Note: the source file for translation can be found in `webman-amplifier/languages/wm_domain.pot`, please use a tool such as [Poedit](http://poedit.net/ "Poedit translator") to translate the file and create an `.MO` file.
